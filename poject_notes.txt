implementation of the game pong in rust using SDL2

use sdl2 for windowing, graphics, and input handling

general idea:
-> initialize sdl2
-> create window and set params
-> initialize sprites(rects and font)
-> start screen
-> struct containing position of left and right paddles
-> struct for ball
-> trait for displayings the structs
-> method on ball checking for collisions
-> clamp of paddles and ball in the y axis
-> score keeping can be contained in paddle structs (like p1 and p2)
-> simple ai for right paddle
->
